# 💻 DSA Practice Set (Arrays to Dynamic Programming)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice problems and solutions — starting from **Arrays** to **Dynamic Programming**.  
It’s designed to strengthen core concepts and prepare for **coding interviews** and **competitive programming**.
